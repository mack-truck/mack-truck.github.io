    <p class="u-text u-text-3">Week 4</p>    
            <p class="u-text u-text-3">The blog from here down is not fully uploaded here. We had an intense week of learning python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and how to use jsons from materials project. Enze has developed an online curriculim so good he will be presenting on it. Will add details on this.</p>    

    <p class="u-text u-text-3">Week 5</p>    
            <p class="u-text u-text-3">learn how to do materials research, begin research</p>    

    <p class="u-text u-text-3">Week 6</p></div>
            <p class="u-text u-text-3">Finish research, draw conclusions based on direct machine learning random trees model. Present possible materials of interest for further research in presentation.

            <h2 class="u-text u-text-2">Lawrencium and DFT</h2>

    <p class="u-text u-text-3">Week 7</p>    
            <p class="u-text u-text-3">Learn too much background on first principals, many body problem, etc. Learn to use super computers "Lawrencium" and lawrence berkeley Lab</p>    

    <p class="u-text u-text-3">Week 8</p>    
            <p class="u-text u-text-3">struggle to get used to using bash to access a supercomputer remotely. Lots of team work. I encouraged us to stay one big group of six and all work together this time.</p>    

<p class="u-text u-text-3">Week 9</p>
<p class="u-text u-text-3">We accomplished an alarming amount of research, and I think this is because we all worked together, arranging for intern-only meetings to assess progress and reassign tasks accordlingly. We also coordinated our presentations to not repeat info. Everyone was impressed. Our findings themselves were unsurprising, and that is good. They followed the laws of physics. I'm not sure what I would have done otherwise.</p>
